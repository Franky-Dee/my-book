\section{ERP Systems}
\par{The ERP archive discovered in the distant past may date back to 1970, when business process integration was the primary goal. The ERP was first used by the Gartner Group, and it went into use at the beginning of 1990. The early 1990s saw the introduction of ERP by software companies like SAP. In 1992, SAP released the R/3 version once more. Customer-server hardware structure was added to the SAP R/3 so that it could operate on many stages at once. By 2000, all of the main ERP software system providers had solved the Y2K challenge. By connecting business and management activities, enterprise resource planning (ERP) tools assist organisations in realising their full potential \citep{uccakturk2013effects}.}
